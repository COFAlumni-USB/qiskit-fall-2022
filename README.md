# Qiskit Fall Fest: Venezuela challenge 2022

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Venezuelan universities. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by [COF Alumni USB](https://www.cofalumniusb.org/?lang=en), please consider joining our organization.

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on Venezuelan universities is going to be a hackathon challenge, starting on October 21st. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below.
